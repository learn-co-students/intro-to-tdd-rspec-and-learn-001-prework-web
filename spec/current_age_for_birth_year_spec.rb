#This one was pretty difficult for me, initially I was excited, read the readme quickly and solved 
#the problem by creating my own method which printed '32' and commeneted out the previous
#code, when I ran the program, it completed the mission, but I could tell it wasn't right
#it turned out that there was already code, but that it just needed to be defined in it's
#own method! This was a fun one and I leaned a bunch. ðŸ¤•
